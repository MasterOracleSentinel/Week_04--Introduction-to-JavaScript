First Array in Memory Step 1

.push() and .pop() Methods


.unshift() and .shift()
.unshift and .shift are exactly like .push and .pop, except 
they operate on the first element in the array. .unshift(element) 
puts a new element in the first position of the array, and .shift() removes the first element in the array.

Task instructions
Task 1
Open the file task-01.js under the folder first-array. You'll see a group of functions to work on.

There are six functions, read each comment and write the return statements for each of them.

It's a good practice to console log the results to help figure out what's expected.

First Array in Memory - Step 2

Arrays - Task 2
Open the file task-02.js under the folder first-array and your code there.

Given an array of strings (words), write a function that would concatenate all the strings in the array to form a sentence. 
The words should be separated by a space.

Hint Have extra spaces? Look into using .trim()!
