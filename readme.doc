Week_04--Introduction-to-JavaScript

In Week 4: Introduction to JavaScript you will study foundational programming concepts at a deeper level. 
While it may feel redundant to what you learned in weeks two and three, this additional practice will solidify 
your understanding so you can integrate more complex concepts in weeks to come.

This week, you will learn how and when to utilize primitive data types and objects to perform specific operations.
You will start by learning how scope impacts variables within a function. 
Next, you will loop through objects and arrays to add data. You will also pass parameters to functions by value 
and by reference and determine which approach is best for your function. Finally, you will showcase these new
skills by building a simulation of the Pac-Man game, creating a Pac-Man that opens and closes its mouth and 
changes direction on screen.
